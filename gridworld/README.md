Welcome to Grid World!!

gridworldExample.ipynb:                                        A great place to start! Introduction to the problem, the model, the experiment, assumptions and other info.

dynamic_programming_sync_policy_iteration_gridworld.ipynb:     An example of using a DP based policy iteration process for control in navigating a 2D maze.

dynamic_programming_sync_policy_iteration_gridworld.ipynb:     An example of a DP based value iteration process for prediction/estimation in navigating a 2D maze. 

envGridworld.ipynb:                                            A custom maze environment (including rewards and a known conditional probability distribution over all action-                                                                  value pairs) used in the various control and prediction/estimation algorithms used in this repo folder.

helpers.ipynb:                                                Provides some functions that print results using matplotlib.
