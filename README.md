<h1>Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning Repository!!</h1>
The following folders listed above contain various reinforcement learning experiments conducted within highly annotated jupyter notebooks.

The folder titled "MonteCarlo" contains various Monte Carlo based methods for estimating the optimal value, state-action value pair, and policy in various hidden Markov model based RL environments.

The folder titled "gridworld" contains various dynamic programming based methods for estimating the optimal value, state-action value pair, and policy in various hidden Markov model based RL environments.
