Each folder contains an experiment. 
The name of each folder orovides information on the algorithm used in the experiment along with the environment used in the experiment. 

For example: The folder named "MonteCarloPrediction_ActionValue_OffPolicy_DiscountAware_Ordinary_ImportanceSampling_EveryVisit_Blackjack"
contains an experiment that uses off policy discount aware ordinary importance sampling to estmiate the action-value pairs on every visit 
used in a reinforcement learning environment such as Gymnasium's blackjack.

Each folder will contain at least one file. This file is a ipython notebook titled with the name of the file's folder name. Additional helper files are included which provided classes and functions for RL environments, visualization of results, etc.
